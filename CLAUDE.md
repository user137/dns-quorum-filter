# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project state

Крок 0 done (SPEC.md §"Фазований план"): Rust workspace, CI, and the RFC-conformance test table
(T-1–T-19) are in place. Phase 1 target platform is Windows (DECISIONS.md, 2026-08-25 — SPEC.md
itself left this open).

Фаза 1, fourth slice done (T-37 — TASKS.md): override lists — allowlist/blocklist with suffix
wildcard match. `dnsqb-service`'s `lib.rs` now re-exports from seven modules — `cache`
(`CacheKey`/`CacheEntry`/`Verdict`/`CacheConfig`/`Cache`, `clamp_ttl`, `chain_cache_ttl`,
`is_cacheable`, T-32/T-34/T-36), `overrides` (`OverrideLists::decision`/`conflicts`/`load`,
`OverrideEntry`/`ListKind`/`InvalidEntry`/`InvalidReason`/`OverrideError`, T-37), `wire` (`DoH` wire codec,
block/NODATA response construction, AD-bit passthrough), `upstream` (`Provider` enum, `DohClient`
trait + `ReqwestDohClient` with per-upstream HTTP/2 keep-alive, T-31), `timeout` (`TimeoutMode`/
`TimeoutConfig`, `VoterOutcome`, `query_with_timeout`, T-27), `quorum` (`is_blocked` per-provider
signature table, `requires_quorum`, OR-logic `resolve()` with early-return/cancellation via
`FuturesUnordered`, T-30), `listener` (`bind_listener`/`BindError`, `127.0.0.1`-only). `lib.rs`'s
own `min_rrset_ttl`/`negative_cache_ttl`/`normalize_domain` are implemented (T-33/T-35/T-38, no
longer `todo!()`) — `overrides.rs`'s `parse_pattern` is the second consumer of `normalize_domain`,
after `cache.rs`'s `CacheKey`. `cache.rs` is **not yet wired to `resolve()`/the request pipeline** —
building a `CacheEntry` from a live `QuorumVerdict` + `Message` needs to branch on positive-answer
(`chain_cache_ttl`) vs. NXDOMAIN/NODATA (`negative_cache_ttl`, from an authority-section SOA
nothing in the project extracts yet) — that's T-39/pipeline-wiring scope. `overrides.rs` is
likewise **not wired to `resolve()`** (same T-39) and has **no file-write path** (`save()` —
deliberately deferred to T-46/T-47, when a UI writer exists; SPEC.md §5 calls the file "редагований
і вручну", manually text-edited, until then). No log wiring either, and no live `hyper`+TLS
listener yet (`main.rs` is still a stub — that needs the self-signed cert, T-48) — those are later
batches. `dnsqb-watcher` is still a stub binary (`todo!()` body); it's Фаза 3 scope (SPEC.md §7).

Runtime dependencies: `hickory-proto`, `tokio` (`rt-multi-thread`/`macros`/`net`/`time`; `test-util`
in `[dev-dependencies]` for `tokio::time::pause`/`advance` in timeout tests), `reqwest`
(`default-features = false`, `rustls`/`http2` only — no `native-tls`), `thiserror`, `base64`,
`futures-util` (`FuturesUnordered`/`StreamExt` only, not the full `futures` crate — T-30), `tracing`
(diagnostic logging, T-29; `SPEC.md`'s "Технічний стек" table doesn't name a logging crate, `tracing`
is the tokio-ecosystem de-facto default — no subscriber wired yet, that's T-48/real-listener scope),
`moka` (`default-features = false`, feature `future` only — concurrent per-entry-TTL cache, T-32),
`serde` (`derive` feature) + `serde_json` (override-list file's on-disk JSON shape, T-37; also the
dependency T-53's Tauri DTO layer will need regardless — introduced now for that long-term purpose,
not as a one-off parser) — vetting rows for each are in SECURITY.md. `[dev-dependencies]` also gained
`tempfile` (T-37, `overrides.rs`'s `load()` tests only — never shipped in a binary). `deny.toml`'s
license allowlist also covers `CDLA-Permissive-2.0` (webpki-root-certs' CA-data license) and `ISC`
(rustls' crypto backend and `rustls-webpki`), both added several batches ago; `futures-util`/
`tracing`/`moka`/`serde`/`serde_json`/`tempfile` didn't need new allowlist entries.

Commands (from repo root):
- `cargo build --workspace` — build both crates.
- `cargo test --workspace --lib` — unit tests (`is_blocked`/quorum, T-61/T-62; `#[tokio::test]` for
  the async quorum cases).
- `cargo test --test conformance -p dnsqb-service` — RFC-conformance tests; green
  (`#[ignore]`d ones stay green, un-`#[ignore]`d ones must actually pass; count of each changes as
  Фаза 1 tasks land — check `TASKS.md` or run `-- --ignored` below for the current red-board size,
  don't trust a hardcoded number here).
- `cargo test --test conformance -p dnsqb-service -- --ignored` — the same tests without the
  ignore filter; intentionally red until each cited Фаза 1 task lands (this is the informational
  red-board step in CI, not a merge gate).
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` — lint gate, required, not advisory
  (`dnsqb-service`'s `lib.rs`/`main.rs` and `dnsqb-watcher`'s `main.rs` also carry
  `#![warn(clippy::pedantic)]` + `#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used)]`, per
  `~/.claude/rules/rust.md`).
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` — format gate.
- `cargo audit` / `cargo deny check` — dependency vetting, required (SECURITY.md, `deny.toml`).
- `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --lib --lcov --output-path lcov.info` — coverage report, published as
  a CI artifact, non-blocking at the MVP stage (T-19).

All of the above run in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on every push/PR, except the `--ignored`
conformance step and `coverage` (both `continue-on-error: true`).

**`SPEC.md` is the source of truth for all design decisions.** Read it before proposing any
architectural change — most non-obvious choices in this project are already deliberated there with
explicit reasoning (search the file for the relevant section number rather than re-deriving a
decision from scratch).

## Rust/tooling gotchas (learned by doing, T-20–T-37 batches)

- `hickory-proto` 0.26.1's API is field-heavy, not method-heavy — `.answers`, `.authorities`,
  `.name`, `.data`, `.metadata.response_code` etc. are public fields, not methods. Check the
  compiler's "field, not a method" hint before assuming a method exists.
- `Message` is `#[non_exhaustive]` — build via `Message::new`/`::query`/`::response`, then mutate
  public fields; no struct-literal construction from outside the crate. `Metadata::
  response_from_request(&query.metadata)` is the documented way to derive a response header.
- `#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used)]` in `lib.rs` applies to inline
  `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` too (same crate) — only the separate `tests/` integration binary is
  exempt. Use `panic!(...)` (via `let-else` or `match`) in inline unit tests instead.
- Async trait methods called via `tokio::join!` need `fn foo(&self, ...) -> impl Future<Output =
  T> + Send`, not `async fn foo`, or `-D warnings` fails on `async_fn_in_trait`'s missing Send
  bound. A mock impl with no `.await` inside needs `std::future::ready(...)` instead of `async fn`
  to satisfy `clippy::unused_async_trait_impl`.
- Windows: the bundled `curl.exe` (Schannel libcurl) has no `--http2` — use PowerShell's
  `Invoke-WebRequest -HttpVersion 2.0` for HTTP/2 (relevant here: `dns.quad9.net` requires it).
- The PowerShell tool's working directory doesn't reliably persist between separate tool calls in
  this environment — `cd` inside the same command string, don't rely on a prior call's `cd`.
- Adding any `rustls`-backed dependency tends to surface new `cargo deny` license entries (seen:
  `ISC` for `aws-lc-rs`/`rustls-webpki`, `CDLA-Permissive-2.0` for `webpki-root-certs`) — expect
  and vet each one in `deny.toml`, don't reflexively widen the allowlist.
- **`reqwest::Error`'s `Display` includes the failed request URL** — for this project's DoH GET
  requests, that URL embeds the base64url-encoded query, i.e. the domain name. Never log an
  `UpstreamError::Http`'s message text directly in a diagnostic-log context (SPEC.md, Наскрізні
  вимоги: no domain names in service logs) — log a coarse error-kind label instead (`quorum.rs`'s
  `error_kind()`). Caught in self-review while writing T-29's logging, not by any lint.
- Boxing differently-shaped `async move { ... }` blocks into one `FuturesUnordered<Pin<Box<dyn
  Future<Output = T> + Send + 'a>>>` (T-30's tagged-future pattern) needs the borrowed generic
  type param itself bound `Sync`, not just `Send` — `&C` across an `.await` inside the box requires
  `C: Sync` or the compiler rejects the `Send`-future cast with a non-obvious error pointing at the
  `&` reference, not at `C`.
- `#[tokio::test(start_paused = true)]` (deterministic `tokio::time::sleep`/`timeout` tests, no real
  waiting) needs the default current-thread runtime — never add `flavor = "multi_thread"` to a
  paused-time test, it panics at runtime (`rt-multi-thread` being enabled for `main.rs`'s own needs
  doesn't carry over to test attributes, which pick their flavor independently).
- **Proving an async cancellation/early-return actually happened, not just that the final verdict
  matches:** a mock future that never resolves on its own (`std::future::pending()`) only proves
  the caller didn't *need* the answer — it doesn't prove the caller *dropped* the future instead of
  waiting out its own `tokio::time::timeout` before falling through to a slower-but-still-correct
  path. Pair the never-resolving mock with `#[tokio::test(start_paused = true)]` and assert
  `tokio::time::Instant::now()` elapsed stays near-zero (well under the configured timeout) — under
  paused time this is deterministic, no real waiting. Caught by advisor review on T-30's tests,
  which passed either way before this fix.
- Constructing a `hickory_proto::ProtoError` for a test-only error fixture: `ProtoError` implements
  `From<String>` — `"description".to_string().into()` is enough, no need to reach for an internal
  `ProtoErrorKind` variant.
- `clippy::duration_suboptimal_units` (this toolchain) rejects `Duration::from_secs(24 * 60 * 60)`
  — use `Duration::from_hours(24)` (stable on this Rust version) instead of a multiplied
  `from_secs`/`from_millis` literal.
- `clippy::unchecked_time_subtraction` rejects `Instant::now() - Duration::from_secs(n)` even in
  test fixtures — `#![deny(clippy::expect_used)]` also applies there (same gotcha as above), so
  pair `Instant::checked_sub` with a `let-else { panic!(...) }`, not `.expect(...)`.
- `moka::future::Cache`'s `Expiry` trait (`moka::policy::Expiry`) takes/returns plain
  `std::time::Instant`/`Duration` — no `moka`-specific time wrapper, confirmed by reading the
  vendored `policy.rs` before writing the impl (0.12.16). Don't assume a wrapper type without
  checking; the crate's own docs don't make this obvious from the trait signature alone.
- Proving `moka`'s `Expiry`-driven eviction actually applies a computed duration (not just that a
  pure freshness-predicate function is correct) needs `moka`'s own real clock — `tokio::time::pause`
  tests the caller's code, not `moka`'s internal removal timing. For that one assertion, a short
  real `tokio::time::sleep` is the right tool, not a `#[tokio::test(start_paused = true)]` violation
  of the usual "avoid real waits" preference.
- **`hickory_proto::rr::Name::from_utf8` silently accepts inputs that look malformed at first
  glance — verify empirically, don't assume a rejection.** `Label::from_utf8` (vendored `label.rs`,
  0.26.1) special-cases a label equal to exactly `"*"` as the legal RFC 1034 wildcard-RR label and
  accepts it without going through the normal IDNA/`Uts46` character check — so a domain like
  `"*.example.com"` parses and "normalizes" successfully, producing a string that still contains a
  literal `*` and can never match a real query domain. `overrides.rs`'s `parse_pattern` (T-37) had
  to add its own explicit `body.contains('*')` guard *before* calling `normalize_domain`, rather
  than trust IDNA to reject it — same for an empty-string domain (`Name::from_utf8("")` normalizes
  to the DNS root, not an error). Both were caught by writing the test first and watching it fail,
  not by reading the source and assuming.
- **Redacting one field of a "no domain names in logs" type doesn't close the leak if a sibling
  field can carry the same text.** `overrides::InvalidEntry`'s first draft (T-37) hand-wrote
  `Debug` to redact its `raw` field, but kept `reason: ProtoError` unredacted — `ProtoError`'s own
  message (and `hickory-proto`'s `Label::from_ascii`, which formats a decode failure as
  `"Malformed label: {s}"`) still carried the domain straight through. Caught by advisor review
  before commit, fixed by making `reason` a coarse, closed enum (`InvalidReason`) with fixed
  per-variant `#[error(...)]` strings — structurally incapable of carrying the domain — rather than
  auditing every field of the type by hand. Proved with a dedicated test
  (`overrides::tests::invalid_entry_debug_output_never_contains_the_raw_pattern_text`) that formats
  `{entry:?}` and asserts the raw text is absent, not just reasoned about.

## Documentation map — who owns what

| File | Owns | Update when |
|---|---|---|
| `SPEC.md` | full design + reasoning: architecture, RFC table, phased plan, open questions | a design decision changes or a new one is made |
| `UI-SPEC.md` | GUI: screen inventory, per-screen field/type tables, Tauri command allowlist draft — no rationale, links back to SPEC.md §8 by section number | a screen, field, or DTO changes; rationale changes go in SPEC.md instead |
| `diagrams/` | architecture + UI diagrams, each anchored to a SOURCES section list; ground-truth ritual in `diagrams/README.md` applies from here on | a diagrammed state/flow/DTO changes — see the ritual's trigger list |
| `CLAUDE.md` | agent-facing summary: commands, architecture at a glance, non-obvious gotchas | architecture/commands change |
| `TASKS.md` | backlog — status only, no reasoning | a task starts/finishes/gets added |
| `DECISIONS.md` | retroactive corrections to already-shipped decisions, with reasoning; overrides SPEC.md by date on conflict | a past decision gets revised |
| `SECURITY.md` | threat model summary, hard security constraints, dependency-vetting table | threat model changes or a dependency is added |
| `README.md` | human-facing project description | repo structure changes |

Don't duplicate a fact across files — link to the owner instead. `SPEC.md` stays the deep source of
truth; the other files summarize or track state, they don't re-derive it.

## Development practices for this project

(Adapted from a personal cross-project practices file — see it only if a point below turns out to
need more detail than fits here.)

- **Test-first, where a unit is isolatable.** SPEC.md §8.1 already instantiates this for the Tauri
  IPC boundary specifically (smoke / exploit / misuse / fuzz, four categories, not one "smoke"
  test) — apply the same discipline (write the failing test before the implementation) to the
  resolver, cache, and override-list logic too, not just the UI channel. A bug fix gets a
  regression test written first, reproducing the bug, before the fix.
- **Три Б (three safety legs) — check all three, not just "is this correct."** This project already
  embodies all three without naming them; naming them is useful as a completeness check when adding
  new logic:
  - *User safety* — does a failure mode leave the user worse off than no filtering at all, and will
    they notice? (Already why silent DoH fallback bypassing quorum is flagged as an open risk in
    SPEC.md, and why the watchdog "must **notify**, not silently self-heal.")
  - *Software safety* — is the code safe against adversarial/malformed input, provably from the line
    itself? Two concrete input boundaries in this project: DNS wire format from upstream providers
    (why `hickory-dns`, not a hand-rolled parser) and the Tauri IPC channel from the webview
    (SPEC.md §8.1's exploit/misuse/fuzz categories exist exactly for this leg).
  - *Lower-layer safety* — every layer this project doesn't own and can't fix is untrusted: the OS
    trust store, upstream DoH providers, the GeoIP/top-sites data feeds (why atomic-replace +
    integrity check before swapping in a new file), and the browser's own DoH-fallback behavior
    (open question 10 in SPEC.md).
- **When SPEC.md is silent on a design question**, don't invent a solution silently — SPEC.md's own
  rule ("RFC over intuition or a competitor's behavior," §"Наскрізні вимоги") is the domain-specific
  version of this; for anything outside RFC's reach (UI/UX choices, non-protocol behavior), fall
  back to: (1) current industry consensus for that class of problem, (2) the API shape of an
  established, well-designed library in the same niche, (3) exposing only the safe/modern mode
  externally, never a legacy/unsafe one as a public entry point. Flag the gap and the choice made,
  don't silently pick one.
- **Any spawned system process (installer invoking `certutil`/`security`, watchdog restarting
  `dnsqb-service`) uses an absolute path, never PATH lookup** — same class of risk as an unquoted
  autostart path; PATH is attacker-influenceable input, not a trusted constant.
- **An empty/ignored `Result`/error branch (`let _ = ...`, `.ok()`, empty `Err(_) => {}`) needs a
  one-line comment saying why it's safe to ignore** — same bar as any other comment (WHY, not WHAT),
  applied to Rust's equivalent of an empty catch block.
- **Before committing, check what's actually staged** (`git status` after `git add`) — don't trust a
  filename alone to mean "no secrets in here."
- **Diagram ground-truth ritual** (`~/.claude/diagram-ground-truth-ritual.md`) — now in effect,
  copied into `diagrams/README.md` once the first diagrams (`ui-*.md`) landed. Check the SOURCES
  block of any diagram you touch, and run the sync checklist before calling doc changes done.
- **Security-ops practices** (`~/.claude/security-ops-practices.md`, alert triage / log
  investigation) apply once `dnsqb-service` is a running system with logs/telemetry to investigate —
  not relevant pre-implementation.

## What this project is

A cross-platform local DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS) server that the browser is pointed at via its built-in
"Custom DoH provider" setting. It fans out each query in parallel to several public filtering DNS
providers (Quad9, AdGuard, Cloudflare, etc.) and blocks a domain if **any one** of them says block
(OR-logic quorum). This is a DNS-level filter, not a uBlock-style cosmetic/element blocker — scope
is deliberately limited to malware/phishing/ads/adult filtering at domain-resolution level.

Two rejected alternative designs, and why (see SPEC.md §"Чому саме такий дизайн"):
- Browser extension with live blocking: Manifest V3 `declarativeNetRequest` can't synchronously
  block a request on an async DoH lookup result; only Firefox still allows blocking `webRequest`.
- System-wide DNS override (`127.0.0.1:53`): no reliable cross-platform crash-recovery guarantee,
  especially on Windows (no OS-level rollback primitive equivalent to macOS's Network Extension).

## Planned stack

Rust workspace, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` everywhere it's possible. Explicit reasons for each
crate are in SPEC.md §"Технічний стек" — don't substitute an alternative without checking that
section first (e.g. `hickory-dns` is chosen specifically to avoid hand-rolling a DNS wire-format
parser, `moka` specifically for its per-entry TTL `Expiry` trait, `rustls` to avoid a system
OpenSSL dependency).

| Component | Crate |
|---|---|
| Async runtime | `tokio` |
| DNS wire format | `hickory-dns` |
| DoH server | `hyper` |
| Upstream HTTP client | `reqwest` |
| TLS | `rustls` |
| Cache | `moka` (per-entry TTL) |
| GeoIP reader | `maxminddb` |
| UI | Tauri |
| Fuzz/property tests | `proptest` |

## Architecture (from SPEC.md)

Two long-running processes:
- **`dnsqb-service`** — the DoH server + quorum resolver. Listens **only** on `127.0.0.1`, never
  `0.0.0.0`. Fixed, configurable port (no silent fallback to another port on conflict).
- **`dnsqb-watcher`** — minimal watchdog process, mutual-heartbeat with the service over 3
  independent channels (IPC socket, shared heartbeat file, HTTP `/health`), majority/unanimous
  voting to avoid a false-positive restart loop (SPEC.md §7).

### Request pipeline (fixed order — see SPEC.md §5.3 for the authoritative, most-recently-corrected version)

```
1. Allowlist        → ALLOW, nothing below is consulted
2. Blocklist        → BLOCK
3. ccTLD block (5.2)→ BLOCK on domain-suffix match, no network call
4. Cache            → cached quorum verdict, if present
5. Rating filter (5.3, opt-in) → BLOCK if domain outside allowed zones (only blocks, never force-ALLOWs)
6. Voter scope (5.1)→ top-N-per-country domains get Security-tier voters only (5.1.1: a personal
                       locally-learned frequent/daily-visit list is a second, opt-in, default-off
                       source for the same exemption, Фаза 4+, T-138); others get all enabled categories
7. Quorum           → query the resolved voter set, OR-logic
8. GeoIP (3.5)      → applied live to cached or fresh ALLOW responses, never cached itself
```

This pipeline has been revised twice in SPEC.md (top-sites handling moved from a bypass mechanism
to a voter-scope exemption in §5.1; the rating filter's position moved from step 0 to a late local
step in §5.3) — when in doubt about ordering, treat the pipeline diagram in §5.3 as current and the
earlier ones in §3.5/§5 as superseded context, not conflicting truth.

### Key non-obvious decisions worth knowing before touching related code

- **Local TLS cert is a single self-signed leaf on `127.0.0.1`, never a local CA** (SPEC.md §2).
  This is called out as the single largest attack surface in the project — a compromised CA key
  enables MITM of arbitrary domains, a compromised leaf key only enables spoofing localhost. Do not
  "simplify" this to a CA-based setup.
- **Block response is `0.0.0.0`/`::` (NULL blocking), never NXDOMAIN** for A/AAAA (SPEC.md §3.2) —
  NXDOMAIN causes some browsers to fall back to a different resolver, silently bypassing the
  filter. Non-A/AAAA types (MX, TXT, HTTPS/SVCB) get NODATA instead.
- **HTTPS/SVCB records bypass quorum entirely**, proxied to a single upstream (SPEC.md §3) —
  Firefox uses HTTPS RR for ECH keys; quorum logic on this type silently disables ECH.
  is_blocked() only applies to A/AAAA.
- **Empty voter set is explicit pass-through, not fail-closed** (SPEC.md §3, §8.1) — if the user
  disables every provider, resolution goes through the unfiltered baseline resolver, and the UI
  must show this as a distinct state, not as a degraded/failure state.
- **GeoIP verdict is never cached alongside the quorum verdict** — it's a cheap local mmap lookup
  applied live on every read (cached or fresh) so a change to the blocked-country list takes effect
  immediately without cache invalidation logic (SPEC.md §3.5).
- **Rating filter (§5.3) can only BLOCK, never force-ALLOW.** A domain inside the allowed zones
  just continues through the normal pipeline (voter scope → quorum → GeoIP) rather than skipping
  it. This is a common implementation mistake per the spec's own regression-test note.
- Timeout handling is one of three configurable modes — `fail-open` (default), `fail-closed`,
  `degraded` — not a single hardcoded policy (SPEC.md §3.3).
- Default upstream preset on first run is **Security category only** (Quad9 Filtered + Cloudflare
  Malware); Ads/Adult are opt-in category toggles, not enabled by default.

### RFC conformance is step 0 of implementation

SPEC.md's phased plan mandates writing the RFC-conformance test table (§"Фазований план", Крок 0)
*before* any resolver code — one row per RFC requirement, with a failing test written before the
implementation that satisfies it. When implementing DNS wire-format, TTL, or negative-caching
behavior, check this table first; default to the cited RFC's behavior over intuition or copying
Pi-hole/AdGuard Home behavior (this is a stated cross-cutting principle, SPEC.md §"Наскрізні
вимоги").

### Privacy constraints that affect design choices throughout

- Domain names are **in-memory ring buffer only** by default (query log) — disk persistence is
  opt-in and must be encrypted via platform secure storage.
- Diagnostic/service logs (errors, timeouts) must never contain domain names.
- Fanning a query out to N upstream providers is a deliberate privacy/coverage tradeoff (more
  third parties see uncached browsing history, in exchange for better threat coverage) — this must
  stay user-visible in the UI, not buried.

## Current phase boundaries

Phase 1 (PoC) scope is explicitly minimal: 1 platform, 2 upstreams (Quad9 + AdGuard), manually
installed cert, override lists + in-memory log — but **no watchdog** (manual restart is acceptable
at PoC stage; §"Фазований план" explicitly defers `dnsqb-watcher` to Phase 3). Don't build ahead of
the current phase's scope without checking whether SPEC.md has already placed that feature in a
later phase for a stated reason (e.g. GeoIP and top-site voter exemption are deliberately deferred
past Phase 1 because they're independent of the core quorum hypothesis being validated first).
